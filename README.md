# 🏡 Advanced House Regression

This project focuses on building advanced regression models to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is based on the popular Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## 🚀 Overview

The goal is to predict the final sale price of each house based on a rich set of features. We explore various regression models and preprocessing steps to achieve high accuracy.

### 🔍 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature engineering)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
